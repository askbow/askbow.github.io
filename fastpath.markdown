Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2  
Abstract: We introduce the key reinstallation attack. This attack abuses design or implementation flaws in cryptographic protocols to reinstall an already-in-use key. This resets the key’s associated parameters such as transmit nonces and receive replay counters. Several types of cryptographic Wi-Fi handshakes are affected by the attack.

+Generic Routing Encapsulation: Add ERSPAN type II tunnel support. One of the purposes is for Linux box to be able to receive ERSPAN monitoring traffic sent from the #cisco switch, by creating a ERSPAN tunnel device. In addition, the patch also adds ERSPAN TX, so Linux virtual switch can redirect monitored traffic to the ERSPAN tunnel device  
+IPv6 Segment Routing

Outages at colocation facilities and IXPs affect the operation of hundreds of networks. In this paper, the authors show that control-plane messages provide an excellent, yet unexplored source of information that can be utilized to detect peering infrastructure outages in the wild. We develop a methodology to analyze the values of the BGP Communities attribute to accurately detect the location of a peering outage at the level of a building.  
  
other notable findings:  
* We find that 53% of the outages are in Europe,  
31% in the US, and the remaining ones in the other regions.  
* The median outage duration is 17 minutes and 40% of the outages exceed 1hour  
* 5% of the monitored 403 facilities fail to meet the 99.99% uptime mark and 18% the 99.999% uptime mark.  
* \[after an outage\] BGP path re-convergence took about 4 hours until 95% of the paths returned

Liveness—whether or not a target IP address responds to a probe packet—is a nuanced concept without a simple yes/no answer. Responsiveness directly depends on the probe type, the configuration  
of the targeted host, as well as on firewalling and filtering behaviors at the edge or within networks.  
  
key findings include:  
(i) TCP and UDP probes increase the population responsive over ICMP by 18%,  
(ii) comprehensively capturing reply traffic (i.e., taking into account negative reply packets) increases the responsive population by more than 13%,  
(iii) TCP stacks do not consistently respond with a TCP Rst for non-available services—in our measurements only 24% of hosts with an active TCP stack respond to all the probes,  
(iv) our concurrent scans allow us to identify nearly 2M tarpits that would bias measurements that do not take them into account, and  
(v) we report on the correlation of responsiveness across protocols uncovering potential filtering practices.  
  
other notable findings:  
* probe redundancy \[sending deferred repeated probes\] increases the population of active IP addresses by 2.2%  
* our scans recorded 487M network alive IPs (IPall) out  
of 3.6B probed.  
* we see that ICMP Echo probes are most effective in discovering network active IPs, revealing 79% of IPall, followed by TCP probes.  
* we find that 16% of IPall can only exclusively be discovered via TCP, and a small but significant ≈2% can only be discovered via UDP probes.

Clusters in the Expanse:  
Understanding and Unbiasing IPv6 Hitlists  
  
In this paper, the authors show that addresses in IPv6 hitlists are heavily clustered. We present novel techniques that allow to push IPv6 hitlists from quantity to quality. We perform a longitudinal active measurement study over 6 months, targeting more than 50 M addresses. We develop a rigorous method to detect aliased prefixes, which identifies 1.5 % of our prefixes as aliased, pertaining to about half of our target addresses. Using entropy clustering, we group the entire hitlist into just 6 distinct addressing schemes. Furthermore, we perform client measurements by leveraging crowdsourcing.

Peng Huang et al., Gray Failure: The Achilles’ Heel of Cloud-Scale Systems //Microsoft Research  
  
Cloud scale provides the vast resources necessary to replace failed components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected. For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle underlying faults, i.e., _gray failure_ rather than fail-stop failure. In this paper, we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences. We  
also argue that a key feature of gray failure is differential observability: that the system’s failure detectors may not notice problems even when applications are afflicted by them. This realization leads us to believe that, to best deal with them, we should focus on bridging the gap between different components’ perceptions of what constitutes failure.  
  
* The ambiguous nature and temporal idiosyncrasy of gray failure make it distinctly different from what is assumed in typical failure models. This defeats traditional fault-tolerance solutions and thus poses significant challenges to cloud practitioners.  
* A natural solution to gray failure is to close the observation gaps between the system and the  
apps that it services. ... This is analogous to making assessments of a human body’s condition: we need to monitor not only his heartbeat, but also other vital signs including temperature and blood pressure.  
* One feasible approach is for a system to measure metrics that approximate the observations of its apps. For example, to tackle the network gray failure example (§2.1), the cloud system can send  
probes to measure server-to-server latency and reachability to emulate observations of the network by common applications  
  
i.e. PfR is the right approach!

Oh, What a Fragile Web We Weave: Third-party Service Dependencies In  
Modern Webservices and Implications  
  
key findings are:  
(1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to reduction in availability due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN, CA services that they exclusively rely on;  
(2) the use of third-party services is concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services go down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web services;  
(3) transitive dependencies significantly increase the set of webservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers, in some cases by ten times  
(4) targeting even less popular webservices can potentially cause significant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the top-100K webservices due to their shared dependencies.

_“Today, we have made the difficult decision to move forward with a restructuring that will affect some of our CX \[customer experience\] colleagues,” Martinez wrote in Tuesday's memo._  
  
_Cisco employs more than 14,000 in Silicon Valley, according to the latest Business Journal research, and about 70,000 people worldwide.  
  
The layoffs, which range from engineers to executives, have affected employees from product marketing, business operations, global architecture and technology services, according to state documents._

**A Large Scale Study of Data Center Network Reliability**  
_This paper fills the gap by presenting a large scale, longitudinal  
study of data center network reliability based on operational data  
collected from the production network infrastructure at Facebook,  
one of the largest web service providers in the world. Our study  
covers reliability characteristics of both intra and inter data center  
networks. For intra data center networks, we study seven years of  
operation data comprising thousands of network incidents across  
two different data center network designs, a cluster network de-  
sign and a state-of-the-art fabric network design. For inter data  
center networks, we study eighteen months of recent repair tick-  
ets from the field to understand reliability of Wide Area Network  
(WAN) backbones_  
  
notable findings:  
* 2 x more human errors than hardware errors  
* rack switch incidents comprise almost a third of all problems, though relatively low priority  
* fabrics in DC have less problems than clusters  
* MTBI / MTTR look exponential  
* SP-provided links fail as often as the edge routers that use them  
* most problems are repaired automatically by means of watchdog-like functionality _(i.e. port shut/no shut, device restart, device reimage)_  
  
They also provide MTBF and MTTR models for leased fiber, though they omit to show if there is a correlation with distance or other factors, only noting that in metro areas, MTBF is higher

on time precision across the Internet  
  
interesting things:  
* there are hosts with clocks running _months_ ahead of UTC  
* most unprecise clocks ~38% are behind UTC, sometimes a whole year behind  
* there are a few interesting clusters of imprecision: exacly 1 hour behind, exactly 12 hours behind, exacly a multiple of 24 hours ahead  
_The strong quantisation of the clock drift into units of hours tends to suggest that a major component of this clock slew is not the drift of the local oscillator or dropping of clock ticks in the time management subsystem, but some form of misconfiguration of the local date calculation. The second counter appears to be quite stable, but the local date calculation is off._

**Ginseng: Keeping Secrets in RegistersWhen You Distrust the Operating System**  
  
_any mobile and embedded apps possess sensitivedata, or secrets. Trusting the operating system (OS), they oftenkeep their secrets in the memory. Recent incidents have shownthat the memory is not necessarily secure because the OS canbe compromised due to inevitable vulnerabilities resulting fromits sheer size and complexity. This work aims to support third-party apps without growingthe attack surface, significant development effort, or performanceoverhead. Our solution, calledGinseng, protects sensitive databy allocating them toregistersat compile time and encryptingthem at runtime before they enter the memory. For example, a Ginseng-enabled web server, Nginx, protects the TLS master key with no measurable overhead_  
  
Also notable:  
* by keeping secrets in registers, Ginseng naturally protects them from cold-boot attacks  
* Although OpenSSL, a TLS library used by Nginx, sanitizes session keys when a session ends, it saves thethe master key in the memory for five minutes for session resumption, which is vulnerable to a compromised OS.

this concept is important going forward, and we can apply it in a larger context, not limited to apps or virtual machines; #networking elements _(routers and switches)_ are often treated as pets, but clearly that does not scale. It also creates a measure of technical debt with unique configurations diverging from the standard

_These three facts all seem eminently sensible and reasonable, right?  
1\. Unix time is the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC  
2\. If I wait exactly one second, Unix time advances by exactly one second  
3\. Unix time can never go backwards_  
  
Not **false** as such, more like imprecise, because _Time is straaaaaange._  
  
These facts about time have implications for distributed clocks, necessary in some consistency models.

**Evidence of Decreasing #internet Entropy: ​The Lack of Redundancy in DNSResolution by Major Websites and Services**  
  
_This paper analyzes the extent to which the Internet’s global domain name resolution (DNS) system haspreserved its distributed resilience given the rise of cloud-based hosting and infrastructure. We explore trendsin the concentration of the DNS space since at least 2011. In addition, we examine changes in domains’tendency to “diversify” their pool of nameservers -- how frequently domains employ DNS managementservices from multiple providers rather than just one provider -- a comparatively costless and thereforepuzzlingly rare decision that could supply redundancy and resilience in the event of an attack or serviceoutage affecting one provider._  
  
The paper starts with providing a primer on DNS workings, then explores DNS #reliability and economics  
  
select findings:  
* _a number of DNS service providers managed to significantly increase their proportional share of the DNS space in that timeframe, beginning to consolidate control of DNS services. Thelinearity of the trend is striking – gains in concentration have been relatively consistent in the long run despiteyearly fluctuations._  
* _percentage of share held by the top 8 providers more than doubled betweenNovember 2011 and May 2017, increasing from about ​24%​ to about ​59%._  
* _expansion of AWS and Cloudflare (which collectively handle about a third of the entire space) is particularlystriking, signalling the increasing influence of multi-service cloud-based platforms in the DNS space_  
* _Entrant domains tended to use CloudFlare and AWS at muchhigher rates than original domains and used Akamai, Dyn, and Neustar relatively less than original domains._  
* _external DNS hosting rapidly overtook self-hosted DNS in the periodbetween November 2011 and May 2017. The percentage of domains managed entirely by external DNS hosting providers grew from 32.9% to ​65.7% ​over that period_  
* _showed that the majority of domains are not taking advantage of this opportunity for resiliencethrough diversification_  
* _customers of some externally hosted DNS providers tended to diversify much morethan others_  
* _near-complete lack of diversification is a product of Cloudflare’s security model,which requires that DNS traffic is routed through the Cloudflare network ... does not allow domains to register a secondary nameserver managed by a different DNS provider._

* _People think Ethernet is a great success, but it has nothing to do with what was originally designed; it just has the same name. It has the same packet format. But the real cleverness was this contention protocol for sharing a link_

**A Performance Perspective on Web OptimizedProtocol Stacks: TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 vs. QUIC  
  
  
  
**_#research In this paper, we seek to close this gap by parameteriz-ing TCP similar to QUIC to enable a fair comparison. Thisincludes increasing the initial congestion window, enablingpacing, setting no slow start after idle, and tuning the kernelbuffers to match QUIC’s defaults. We further enable BBRinstead of the CUBIC as the congestion control algorithm inone scenario. We show that this previously neglected tuningof TCP impacts its performance. We find that for broadbandaccess, QUIC’s RTT-optimized connection establishment in-deed increases the loading speed, but otherwise compares toTCP. If optimizations such as TLS 1.3 early-data or TCP FastOpen were deployed, QUIC and TCP would compare well.  
  
_**contributions:  
**_\* We provide the first study that performs an eye-level com-parison of TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 and QUIC.  
*Our study highlights that QUIC can indeed outperform TCP in a variety of settings but so does a tuned TCP.  
*Tuning TCP closes the gap to QUIC and shows that TCP is still very competitive to QUIC.  
*Our study further highlights the immense impact of choiceof congestion control, especially in lossy environments.  
*We add QUIC support to Mahimahi to enable reproducible QUIC research. It replays real-world websites in a testbed subject to different protocols and network settings.  
  
_takeaway: Basically, for many cases using a tuned TCP stack renders results just as good or rather _good\_enough_ as QUICK; no need to rush a migration

SHA-1 is now broken, the attack was made practical by this group, with cost below 100k$, prognosed to become ~10k$ in the near future
Good short read on the problem and its implications for security.

continuation of a story where a group of people found a "perfectly lawful" way to profit off non-profit

their scheme is:
1. using their regulatory power remove price limits from .org
2. sell management rights to a private firm owned by their friends
3. ...
4. PROFIT!
